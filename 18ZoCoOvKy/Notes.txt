18ZoCoOvKy tables 2 and 3  provide empirical energy levels with comparisons 
to variational computations. 
These variational energies for the refined surface, using TROVE
will be used to match to the CoYuTe line list and provide the block number. 
States without a variational energy will be discarded

Some lines have the same theoretical intensities and assignments

18ZoCoOvKy.258
18ZoCoOvKy.296
18ZoCoOvKy.298
18ZoCoOvKy.260
Three possible upper states. Assigned 1794 and 1795. Each pair gives a single upper states
through CDs.

18ZoCoOvKy.300 is one of two assignments for an experimental line. No other transition to
the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.300 hence it is to be invalidated. The other proposed
assignment 18ZoCoOvKy.301 is it forms a CD upper state with another transition.

18ZoCoOvKy.107
18ZoCoOvKy.108
18ZoCoOvKy.148
18ZoCoOvKy.149
Two experimental transitions with each having two suggested 
theoretical assignments. 18ZoCoOvKy.107 and 18ZoCoOvKy.148 
are taken to be correct as the CD more closely agrees with 
the empircal level from table 2.
