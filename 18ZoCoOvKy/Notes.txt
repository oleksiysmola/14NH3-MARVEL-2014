18ZoCoOvKy tables 2 and 3  provide empirical energy levels with comparisons 
to variational computations. 
These variational energies for the refined surface, using TROVE
will be used to match to the CoYuTe line list and provide the block number. 
States without a variational energy will be discarded

Some lines have the same theoretical intensities and assignments

18ZoCoOvKy.258
18ZoCoOvKy.296
18ZoCoOvKy.298
18ZoCoOvKy.260
Three possible upper states. Assigned 1794 and 1795. Each pair gives a single upper states
through CDs.

18ZoCoOvKy.300 is one of two assignments for an experimental line. No other transition to
the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.300 hence it is to be invalidated. The other proposed
assignment 18ZoCoOvKy.301 is it forms a CD upper state with another transition.

18ZoCoOvKy.107
18ZoCoOvKy.108
18ZoCoOvKy.148
18ZoCoOvKy.149
Two experimental transitions with each having two suggested 
theoretical assignments. 18ZoCoOvKy.107 and 18ZoCoOvKy.148 
are taken to be correct as the CD more closely agrees with 
the empircal level from table 2.

18ZoCoOvKy.173
18ZoCoOvKy.174
 18ZoCoOvKy.59
 18ZoCoOvKy.60
Two experimental transitions each given two possible assignments corresponding to one CD upper state.
These lines are invalidated since empirical levels from table 2 are the same for both possible upper
upper states. Also 18ZoCoOvKy.101 has the upper state quantum numbers but the CD 
is slightly different (within uncertainties though). Assumed to be of the same upper
state implied by 18ZoCoOvKy.174 and 18ZoCoOvKy.60.

18ZoCoOvKy.304
18ZoCoOvKy.254
Form a CD upper state potentially even with 18ZoCoOvKy.271 even though the latter has a different
upper state label. The latter has been invalidated as it is ambigious which state in the states
file is the corresponding match. 

18ZoCoOvKy.133
Same upper state quantum numbers as 
18ZoCoOvKy.138
18ZoCoOvKy.100
but with the current assignment would correspond to another upper state. As we have two 
transitions for the latter assignment, we retain these and invalidate the lone 18ZoCoOvKy.133 
transition. 

18ZoCoOvKy.266
18ZoCoOvKy.279 
Found an upper state that potentially matches with same rotational quantum numbers
but vibrational assignment has been changed.

 18ZoCoOvKy.65
18ZoCoOvKy.146
18ZoCoOvKy.178
Correspond to one of two fairly close lying states with same quantum number labels except Nb.
We opt for the lower of the two states 2852 as that is the assignment corresponding to 
the refined level given in 18ZoCoOvKy.

18ZoCoOvKy.302
18ZoCoOvKy.280
Potentially three upper states with the same quantum numbers. We opt for the highest of the three
5674 because that is the closest to the quoted refined level in the empirical energy levels list
of 18ZoCoOvKy.

18ZoCoOvKy.301
18ZoCoOvKy.265
No refined level given in paper, assigned closest state of same J-Gamma with same quantum numbers.

18ZoCoOvKy.63
18ZoCoOvKy.154
18ZoCoOvKy.78
Seem to form a combination difference to the same level, either that or seperate very
close lying levels. 18ZoCoOvKy.63 and 18ZoCoOvKy.78 are reassigned as they have no corresponding
empirical levels in the paper and combination difference differs by about 0.001 so the current 
assumption is they have the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.154.

18ZoCoOvKy.288
Has the same vibrational upper state assignment as 18ZoCoOvKy.291 and 18ZoCoOvKy.255 however through
CD corresponds to a different upper state. The state corresponding to the latter two appears in the 
empirical levels list and along with the corresponding refined energy so a match could be found in 
the states file. For 18ZoCoOvKy.288 it is not clear which state is the corresponding one from the states
file and so is left invalidated for now.

18ZoCoOvKy.283
18ZoCoOvKy.257
Have the same vibrational upper state labels but through CD correspond to different levels. One suitable 
match is can be found in the vicinity of the empirical energy but it is not clear which of these two 
states it would correspond to. Both lines are invalidated

18ZoCoOvKy.316
18ZoCoOvKy.244
Same upper state with two possible matches in the states file. We take the closest energy level to be 
the match.

18ZoCoOvKy.321
18ZoCoOvKy.250
Not in emprical levels list. Match found in states file with different vibrational assignment. 
Reassigned.

18ZoCoOvKy.120 
Quoted empirical level gives a substantial difference from CD lvl predicted by MARVEL ~ 60 cm-1
Invalidated for the time being

18ZoCoOvKy.71 
~ 3 cm-1 difference between empirical level from table and that predicted by MARVEL 
Invalidated for the time being.

18ZoCoOvKy.180
18ZoCoOvKy.181
 18ZoCoOvKy.32
 18ZoCoOvKy.33
Two transitions each proposed two different assignments. Two close lying states in the states file to 
match too as well so both scenarios are included. A third transition 18ZoCoOvKy.121 is assumed to 
only go to the highest of these two states and so therefore breaks the energy degeneracy.
