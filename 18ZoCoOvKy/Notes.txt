18ZoCoOvKy tables 2 and 3  provide empirical energy levels with comparisons 
to variational computations. 
These variational energies for the refined surface, using TROVE
will be used to match to the CoYuTe line list and provide the block number. 
States without a variational energy will be discarded

Some lines have the same theoretical intensities and assignments

18ZoCoOvKy.258
18ZoCoOvKy.296
18ZoCoOvKy.298
18ZoCoOvKy.260
Three possible upper states. Assigned 1794 and 1795. Each pair gives a single upper states
through CDs.

18ZoCoOvKy.300 is one of two assignments for an experimental line. No other transition to
the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.300 hence it is to be invalidated. The other proposed
assignment 18ZoCoOvKy.301 is it forms a CD upper state with another transition.

18ZoCoOvKy.107
18ZoCoOvKy.108
18ZoCoOvKy.148
18ZoCoOvKy.149
Two experimental transitions with each having two suggested 
theoretical assignments. 18ZoCoOvKy.107 and 18ZoCoOvKy.148 
are taken to be correct as the CD more closely agrees with 
the empircal level from table 2.

18ZoCoOvKy.173
18ZoCoOvKy.174
 18ZoCoOvKy.59
 18ZoCoOvKy.60
Two experimental transitions each given two possible assignments corresponding to one CD upper state.
These lines are invalidated since empirical levels from table 2 are the same for both possible upper
upper states. Also 18ZoCoOvKy.101 has the upper state quantum numbers but the CD 
is slightly different (within uncertainties though). Assumed to be of the same upper
state implied by 18ZoCoOvKy.174 and 18ZoCoOvKy.60.

18ZoCoOvKy.304
18ZoCoOvKy.254
Form a CD upper state potentially even with 18ZoCoOvKy.271 even though the latter has a different
upper state label. The latter has been invalidated as it is ambigious which state in the states
file is the corresponding match. 

18ZoCoOvKy.133
Same upper state quantum numbers as 
18ZoCoOvKy.138
18ZoCoOvKy.100
but with the current assignment would correspond to another upper state. As we have two 
transitions for the latter assignment, we retain these and invalidate the lone 18ZoCoOvKy.133 
transition. 

18ZoCoOvKy.266
18ZoCoOvKy.279 
Found an upper state that potentially matches with same rotational quantum numbers
but vibrational assignment has been changed.
