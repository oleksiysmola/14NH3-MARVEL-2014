18ZoCoOvKy tables 2 and 3  provide empirical energy levels with comparisons 
to variational computations. 
These variational energies for the refined surface, using TROVE
will be used to match to the CoYuTe line list and provide the block number. 
States without a variational energy will be discarded

Here is a list of lines noted to have questionable assignments and yet form a level through CD

Some lines have the same theoretical intensities and assignments

18ZoCoOvKy.258
18ZoCoOvKy.296
18ZoCoOvKy.298
18ZoCoOvKy.260
Three possible upper states. Assigned 1794 and 1795. Each pair gives a single upper states
through CDs.

18ZoCoOvKy.300 is one of two assignments for an experimental line. No other transition to
the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.300 hence it is to be invalidated. The other proposed
assignment 18ZoCoOvKy.301 is it forms a CD upper state with another transition.

18ZoCoOvKy.107
18ZoCoOvKy.108
18ZoCoOvKy.148
18ZoCoOvKy.149
Two experimental transitions with each having two suggested 
theoretical assignments. 18ZoCoOvKy.107 and 18ZoCoOvKy.148 
are taken to be correct as the CD more closely agrees with 
the empircal level from table 2.

18ZoCoOvKy.173
18ZoCoOvKy.174
 18ZoCoOvKy.59
 18ZoCoOvKy.60
Two experimental transitions each given two possible assignments corresponding to one CD upper state.
These lines are invalidated since empirical levels from table 2 are the same for both possible upper
upper states. Also 18ZoCoOvKy.101 has the upper state quantum numbers but the CD 
is slightly different (within uncertainties though). Assumed to be of the same upper
state implied by 18ZoCoOvKy.174 and 18ZoCoOvKy.60.

18ZoCoOvKy.304
18ZoCoOvKy.254
Form a CD upper state potentially even with 18ZoCoOvKy.271 even though the latter has a different
upper state label. The latter has been invalidated as it is ambigious which state in the states
file is the corresponding match. 

18ZoCoOvKy.133
Same upper state quantum numbers as 
18ZoCoOvKy.138
18ZoCoOvKy.100
but with the current assignment would correspond to another upper state. As we have two 
transitions for the latter assignment, we retain these and invalidate the lone 18ZoCoOvKy.133 
transition. 

18ZoCoOvKy.266
18ZoCoOvKy.279 
Found an upper state that potentially matches with same rotational quantum numbers
but vibrational assignment has been changed.

 18ZoCoOvKy.65
18ZoCoOvKy.146
18ZoCoOvKy.178
Correspond to one of two fairly close lying states with same quantum number labels except Nb.
We opt for the lower of the two states 2852 as that is the assignment corresponding to 
the refined level given in 18ZoCoOvKy.

18ZoCoOvKy.302
18ZoCoOvKy.280
Potentially three upper states with the same quantum numbers. We opt for the highest of the three
5674 because that is the closest to the quoted refined level in the empirical energy levels list
of 18ZoCoOvKy.

18ZoCoOvKy.301
18ZoCoOvKy.265
No refined level given in paper, assigned closest state of same J-Gamma with same quantum numbers.

18ZoCoOvKy.63
18ZoCoOvKy.154
18ZoCoOvKy.78
Seem to form a combination difference to the same level, either that or seperate very
close lying levels. 18ZoCoOvKy.63 and 18ZoCoOvKy.78 are reassigned as they have no corresponding
empirical levels in the paper and combination difference differs by about 0.001 so the current 
assumption is they have the same upper state as 18ZoCoOvKy.154.

18ZoCoOvKy.288
Has the same vibrational upper state assignment as 18ZoCoOvKy.291 and 18ZoCoOvKy.255 however through
CD corresponds to a different upper state. The state corresponding to the latter two appears in the 
empirical levels list and along with the corresponding refined energy so a match could be found in 
the states file. For 18ZoCoOvKy.288 it is not clear which state is the corresponding one from the states
file and so is left invalidated for now.

18ZoCoOvKy.283
18ZoCoOvKy.257
Have the same vibrational upper state labels but through CD correspond to different levels. One suitable 
match is can be found in the vicinity of the empirical energy but it is not clear which of these two 
states it would correspond to. Both lines are invalidated

18ZoCoOvKy.316
18ZoCoOvKy.244
Same upper state with two possible matches in the states file. We take the closest energy level to be 
the match.

18ZoCoOvKy.321
18ZoCoOvKy.250
Not in emprical levels list. Match found in states file with different vibrational assignment. 
Reassigned.

18ZoCoOvKy.120 
Quoted empirical level gives a substantial difference from CD lvl predicted by MARVEL ~ 60 cm-1
Invalidated for the time being

18ZoCoOvKy.71 
~ 3 cm-1 difference between empirical level from table and that predicted by MARVEL 
Invalidated for the time being.

18ZoCoOvKy.180
18ZoCoOvKy.181
 18ZoCoOvKy.32
 18ZoCoOvKy.33
Two transitions each proposed two different assignments. Two close lying states in the states file to 
match too as well so both scenarios are included. A third transition 18ZoCoOvKy.121 is assumed to 
only go to the highest of these two states and so therefore breaks the energy degeneracy.

18ZoCoOvKy.140 seems to form a CD level with 18ZoCoOvKy.42 which is assigned to the a state
whereas the former is assigned to the s state. Since the CD agrees with the empirical 
value of Table 2 which is the a state, we reassign 18ZoCoOvKy.140 to the a state

18ZoCoOvKy.319
18ZoCoOvKy.289
18ZoCoOvKy.326
18ZoCoOvKy.252
Form two seperate combination differences, both empirical levels appear in Table 3.
First empirical level has no matching refined level for comparison. 
Second empirical level does. We change Nb number for the second to more closely match
the quoted refined level. Vibrational quantum numbers also reassigned to match.

18ZoCoOvKy.305
18ZoCoOvKy.263
18ZoCoOvKy.315
18ZoCoOvKy.281
Three CD levels for two closish states. Empirical level for both, however 
upper state has no refined level in Table 3. For now we assume the two 
matches belong to 18ZoCoOvKy.315 and 18ZoCoOvKy.281 respectively, as 
two distinct states Nb = 7050, 7951. As 18ZoCoOvKy.305, 18ZoCoOvKy.263 form 
a CD level we assign them to state Nb = 7929 but this is a tenious assignment.

18ZoCoOvKy.243
18ZoCoOvKy.295
Appear to correspond to two different upper states through CD. Two states can
can be found to match them although giving a differing refined energy to the one offered in 
Table 3.

18ZoCoOvKy.282
No matching refined level in Table 3 or similarly assigned state in the states file. 
Invalidated

 18ZoCoOvKy.45
18ZoCoOvKy.124
CD level has no refined level in Table 2 and two close matches in the states file. Assigned
closest match. 

18ZoCoOvKy.337
18ZoCoOvKy.294
Empirical level not given but a state is nonetheless found in the states file.

18ZoCoOvKy.54
Empirical level not given in Table 2 and states file contains three possible matches.
Invalidated.

 18ZoCoOvKy.50
18ZoCoOvKy.192
18ZoCoOvKy.162
18ZoCoOvKy.194
 18ZoCoOvKy.52
18ZoCoOvKy.111
 18ZoCoOvKy.16
For some reason the refined levels are flipped when matched to the empirical levels of Table 2.
Three close matches exist within 0.1 cm-1 of the adjacent level. We choose the two highest 
energy states to correspond to the upper state energies.

18ZoCoOvKy.293
18ZoCoOvKy.334
Assigned differently yet appear to correspond to the same CD level. The former has no empircal
level given in Table 3 whereas the latter does. 18ZoCoOvKy.293 is reassigned to match the 
assignment of the former. 

18ZoCoOvKy.147
 18ZoCoOvKy.61
One CD level with two possible matches around ~ 9 cm-1 off the empirical value.
Quoted refined level from Table 2 also ~ 4 cm-1 off values that could match in states file.

 18ZoCoOvKy.43
18ZoCoOvKy.187
 18ZoCoOvKy.14
18ZoCoOvKy.103
18ZoCoOvKy.161
All seem to correspond to same upper state through CD test but 18ZoCoOvKy.187 is assigned
to the s state whereas the rest are assigned the to the a state. 18ZoCoOvKy.187 is reassigned
to the a state. 

18ZoCoOvKy.212
18ZoCoOvKy.195
 18ZoCoOvKy.18
18ZoCoOvKy.117
 18ZoCoOvKy.19
18ZoCoOvKy.198
Two CD states and two possible matches in the states file yet with current assignment
the order in the states file would be different to their empirical ordering. The vibrational
assignments have therefore been swapped.

18ZoCoOvKy.201
No matches obvious matches found in states file. And empirical level not present in Table 2.

18ZoCoOvKy.172
 18ZoCoOvKy.40
CD level with two possible matches in states file. Two empirical levels in table 2.
The CD lvl for the other state is not found but the 18ZoCoOvKy.172 and 18ZoCoOvKy.40
correspond to the lower of the two empirical levels and so is assigned the lower energy
state in the states file.

  18ZoCoOvKy.7
18ZoCoOvKy.214
Matching empirical level has suggests different refined level to possible matches in 
states file. Closest match in states file is chosen.

18ZoCoOvKy.131
No states that seem to match in states file and no empirical level in Table 2.
Invalidated

18ZoCoOvKy.274
18ZoCoOvKy.330
Suggested refined level in Table 3 is around 10 cm-1 below the a close match in 
the states file.

18ZoCoOvKy.135
No refined level in Table 2. Assigned closest match.

 18ZoCoOvKy.24
18ZoCoOvKy.168
Difference in predicted CD level > uncertainties of transition. Invalidated

 18ZoCoOvKy.83
18ZoCoOvKy.217
18ZoCoOvKy.177
 18ZoCoOvKy.35
Four possible states in the states file to match to! Assigned based on refined
level matches in Table 2.


18ZoCoOvKy.261
18ZoCoOvKy.332
Closest matching state in states file is ~ 2 cm-1 below suggested refined energy 
from Table 3.

18ZoCoOvKy.234
Empirical level in Table 2 ~ 0.6 cm-1 off CD level. Suggested refined lvl matches with
state of opposite inversion symmetry. Invalidated. 

18ZoCoOvKy.232
Empirical level not present in Table 2. Invalidated as no match found in states file.

18ZoCoOvKy.230
Refined level in Table 2 > 10 cm-1 off so opted for closer match in states file.

18ZoCoOvKy.224
 18ZoCoOvKy.69
Match in states file has different vibrational assignment to that given in paper.
We change vibrational labels to that given in the states file.

18ZoCoOvKy.23
Invalidated as it falls between two levels confirmed through CD and have 
corresponding empirical and refined levels in Table 2. No matches found for
18ZoCoOvKy.23.
