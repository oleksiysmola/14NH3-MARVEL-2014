# MARVEL NH3
The purpose of this repository is to track changes throughout the application of the MARVEL procedure (Measured Active Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels) (Furtenbacher et al. 2007) to transitions of the main ammonia isotopologue. The present work is intended to be an update of the previous MARVEL energy levels obtained by (Furtenbacher et al. 2020). The work may end up forming the basis of an ORBYTS outreach project.
